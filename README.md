## Introduction
Central bank digital currency (CBDC) is the digital form of fiat money which is a currency established as money by government regulation or law. CDBC combines the characteristics of central bank currency and digital currency-centralization and distributed ledger. CBDC is only a hypothetical model till now.

CBDC was born because digital currency has some inherent defects, but it also has advantages that traditional central bank currency does not have.

## Birth defects of CBDC
Private digital currency develops rapidly in the post-financial crisis era under the background of global currency competitiveness overrun, but the inherent defects of private digital currency make it unable to become a real currency.

### 1.Instability of value
The market price of digital money is very unstable for it does not have country credit endorsement, so it cannot be used as store of value. Bitcoin prices have risen all the way since the beginning of 2017, reaching an all-time high of $19373.14 on December 16, 2017, and then began to fall, falling to $1348.02 at the lowest level, with a maximum decline of 16.72%, the biggest drop since January 2015. The price of ET coin has changed more dramatically, rising nearly 90 times in 2017. The sharp rise and fall of Bitcoin and the rapid rise of the Ethernet coin reflect the great volatility of the private digital money market.

### 2.Low transaction validation rate
The transaction validation rate of digital currency is very low, so it cannot be used as Medium of exchange. In Bitcoin system, broadcasting information transmission and hashing operations take a lot of computing power and time. As a result, the overall service processing capacity of Bitcoin system is limited. It is estimated that only seven services can be processed per second, while the average number of services processed by Visa is between 2000 and 7000.

### 3. Fixed and limited money supply
The money supply of digital currency is fixed and limited, so money policy cannot be implemented. In the Bitcoin system, the money supply increases with time, and the increased Bitcoins are acquired by the "excellent miners" who have the strongest computing power in an operation cycle. However, the total number of Bitcoins is about 21 million, and the growth mechanism is relatively stylized. The number of Bitcoins produced each time is relatively fixed and lack of controllability.

### 4. Difficult to effectively supervise
n some payment scenarios, private digital currency can replace legal currency for payment, but private digital currency is not controlled by the central bank. If the use of private digital money exceeds a certain limit, it will affect the implementation and transmission of the central bank's monetary policy. At the same time, the great volatility of the value of private digital currency makes it easy to cause market panic and risk events, and poses a threat to the stability of the financial system. In addition, private digital currency generally has the characteristics of anonymity, unregulated funds and transnational flows, which may encourage illegal traders to use private digital currency to cover up their real trading intentions, and enterprises and individuals to use private digital currency to achieve the purpose of tax evasion and tax evasion. However, in the field of private digital currency, the absence of regulation is serious, and it is difficult for relevant departments to effectively supervise private digital currency.

## Advantages of CBDC
The issuance of statutory digital currency by the central bank is based on the realistic demand of the innovation and development of the traditional banking system.

### 1.The statutory digital currency makes the formulation and implementation of monetary policy more effective
 Statutory digital currency can make full use of scientific and technological means such as block chain, big data and controllable cloud computing to provide more sufficient and accurate basis for monetary policy formulation. Meanwhile, the point-to-point payment and settlement characteristics of statutory digital currency will accelerate the currency circulation speed, thus creating high liquidity for financial market, making the term structure of interest rate more smooth and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. More smoothly.

### 2.Statutory digital currency makes financial regulation more precise
At present, the small transactions of the public are mainly carried out through the third-party payment instruments. The third-party payment institutions have accumulated a considerable amount of large payment data, and the central bank has lost part of the control of currency circulation data. The legal digital currency can replace the electronic currency paid by the third party in function, and it has the support of national credit, which will return the control of the big data of currency circulation to the central bank. The big data of money circulation can provide the central bank with complete and true transaction records at different frequencies and levels, make the monitoring and management of the central bank's capital flow more effective, and provide the basis for the formulation and implementation of macro-prudential policies and micro-financial supervision measures.

### 3.	Extensibility of system capacity and efficiency
Extensibility means that the capacity and efficiency of the finance system can be expanded infinitely. In terms of improving performance efficiency, common methods include: shortening block generation interval, increasing block size, adopting double-layer chain structure, introducing lightning network, pruning data in blocks without affecting security, etc. In terms of system expansion or functional expansion, atomic transaction, side-chain protocol (such as Rootstock), chain relay protocol (such as: BTC Relay), etc.

### 3.Reduce the circulation cost and improve the efficiency of fund settlement
Businesses and individuals will also benefit. 
Firstly, legal digital currency can reduce the circulation cost. If commercial banks no longer need to transport large amounts of money but can transfer money by electronic means, the loss cost and maintenance cost of the whole process will be greatly reduced. 
Second, statutory digital currency can improve the efficiency of fund settlement. Statutory digital currency uses block chain technology to construct point-to-point payment mode. The realization of payment and settlement process no longer requires third-party clearing institutions or payment centers. The payment and settlement activities of enterprises and individuals are more convenient, settlement costs are greatly reduced, and the efficiency of fund settlement and management is expected to be significantly improved.
Thirdly，it solves the trust problem in transaction. Each participant in this network can get a true and unique copy of information. Any changes in the books will be reflected in all copies. It increases the risk of tampering with information and fraud because it improves the security of the system and Solve the trust problem in transaction.


## Case Study: CSCoin
RSCoin is the Bank of England's central bank digital currency program.
RSCoin introduces a degree of centralization into the two typically decentralized components of a blockchain-based ledger: the generation of the monetary supply and the constitution of the transaction ledger. 
In its simplest form, the RSCoin system assumes two structural entities:
1) the central bank, a centralized entity that ultimately has complete control over the generation of the monetary supply
2) a distributed set of mintettes that are responsible for the maintenance of the transaction ledger. 

### Running mechanism of RSCoin

![data overview](https://github.com/wangtian2019/Central-Bank-Digital-Currency/blob/master/%E5%9B%BE2.png)

The figure above shows the overall structure of RSCoin. 
Firstly, mintettes collect transactions from users and write them into blocks. These mintettes differ from traditional cryptocurrency miners: rather than performing some computationally difficult task, each mintette is simply authorized by the central bank to collect transactions. In RSCoin, this authorization is accomplished by a PKI-type functionality, meaning the central bank signs the public key of Each mintettes maintains a set of lower-level blocks, and communicates with other mintettes. At some point, the mintettes send these blocks to the central bank, which produces a higher-level block. It is these higher-level blocks that form a chain and that are visible to external users.

![data overview](https://github.com/wangtian2019/Central-Bank-Digital-Currency/blob/master/%E5%9B%BE3.png)

The figure above shows the proposed protocol for validating transactions: each mintette mi is an owner of address i. In (1), a user learns the owners of each of the addresses in its transaction. In (2), the user collects approval from a majority of the owners of the input addresses. In (3), the user sends the transaction and these approvals to the owners of the transaction identifier. In (4), some subset of these mintettes add the transaction to their blocks.

An example transaction algorithm：

### Lower-level blocks：

**Format**: b = (h,txset,σ,mset)，h = H(h(i−1) bank ||h(m) j−1||otherblocksk||txset)

**h (i−1)** bank refers to the hash value submitted by the previous period to the bank. 
**h (m) j−1** refers to the hash value of the block of the previous m group (a period may contain many epoch).
**otherblocksk** refers to the hash value interacted with the tetepmin, and the hash value of **txset** refers to all sets of transactions of an epoch.In combination, **σ** is the signature of mintette, and **mset** is the hash set of other mintettes that interacts with this mintette.

**Note**: The txset submitted to central bank by mintettes of the same shard should be the same

### Higher-level  blocks：

**Format**: Bbanki= (h,txset,σ,DPKi+1)

**Note**: DPKi+1 has some effect. For example, if a mintettes fails in a transaction, it will not get the keypair of the next period. It may not be passed or found when submitting a block

**1) Money production**: tx（NULL→ addrbank）. Use bitcoin-like mining to generate coins- use a transaction without the original address to send a certain amount of money to the address of the bank in a transaction without the original address.

**2) Cost distribution**: tx(addrbank→ addrm).  The key point is not how to allocate the cost to mintette, but to whom. So the allocation strategy is that central bank has a counter for checking the input mintettes as a basis for allocation costs. Considering that the output must be used as input in order to be rewarded, this strategy not only encourages mintette to do the first phase work, but also indirectly motivates them to do the second phase. 

**3) About log**: Logs are sent to central bank, and whether they are published is a question. If the central bank is not honest enough, the user can try to obtain the distributed log by broadcasting, so that the user can verify the behavior of mintettes, and at the same time can repeat operations to compare the books, which can prevent the bank from negligent behavior.

### Security features
*Most mintettes are honest.

*No double-spending.

*User can determine the potential behavior of a mintette that matches the previous behavior at the same time.

*Everyone can audit mintettes'transactions, so mintettes can't modify, ignore and insert transactions afterwards.

*Mintettes'inaction will be exposed and will not receive transaction costs.

### Performance
Denote by T the set of transactions that are generated per second; by Q the number of mintettes that own each address; and by M the number of total mintettes.
For a transaction with m inputs and n outputs, a user sends and receives at most mQ messages in the first phase of the 2PC protocol and sends and receives at most Q messages in the second phase. For the user, each transaction thus requires at most 2(m + 1)Q messages.
In terms of the communication complexity per mintette, assume that each mintette receives a proportional share of the total transactions, which is ensured as the volume of transactions grow, by the bank allocating shards of equal sizes to all mintettes. Then the work per mintette is:
![data overview](https://github.com/wangtian2019/Central-Bank-Digital-Currency/blob/master/%E5%9B%BE7.png)

In particular, this scales infinitely: as more mintettes are added to the system, the work per mintette decreases and eventually goes to zero.

### 	Consensus protocols
Consensus protocols is used to achieve availability and consistency, which is the key technology of distributed ledger system. Its core indicators include the robustness of consensus protocol, efficiency and security. Representational consensus mechanisms include PoW, PoS, PBFT, RSCoin, hybrid consensus, etc.

PoW (Proof of Work) is a mature consensus technology in block chain. Its characteristic is that it requires a certain amount of work to obtain the right to create blocks. At present, the mainstream digital currency uses PoW. However, PoW has been criticized for its waste of resources and selfish mining, and its performance efficiency has great limitations. Thus application in the trade finance should explore other more innovative mechanism. 
RSCoin employs an innovative consensua protocols. Its characteristics are hierarchical structure, separation of transaction verification and accounting, centralization of accounting, strong security assumptions, but relatively efficient.
